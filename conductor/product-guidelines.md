# Product Guidelines: Note Geval

## Voice and Tone
Note Geval should speak with a **Friendly & Encouraging** voice. While it is a technical tool, it should feel like a supportive companion for the user's personal knowledge journey.
- **Supportive:** Use helpful language that guides the user.
- **Clear & Concise:** Avoid jargon where possible, but remain precise.
- **Action-Oriented:** When errors occur or instructions are needed, focus on the "next best action" for the user.

## Visual Identity
The visual aesthetic is **Modern & Clean**, prioritizing readability and focus.
- **Typography First:** Use clear, legible fonts with generous line height and spacing to make reading and writing Markdown a pleasure.
- **High Contrast:** Ensure text is easily readable against backgrounds, following accessibility standards.
- **Intentional Whitespace:** Use whitespace to separate concerns and prevent the interface from feeling cluttered, especially in the file explorer and note editor.

## User Experience Principles
- **Supportive Error Handling:** Error messages should be empathetic and provide a clear path to resolution. Avoid technical codes without a human-readable explanation.
- **Frictionless Quick Capture:** On mobile, the interface should prioritize the ability to quickly jot down a note or idea.
- **Mobile-Optimized Reading:** The reading experience on mobile should be as comfortable as on desktop, with fluid layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.
- **Zero-Config Mentality:** Sensible defaults should be chosen so the user can start being productive immediately after installation.
