# Product Guide: Note Geval

## Executive Summary
Note Geval is a self-hosted Next.js web application designed for users who prioritize data ownership and high-performance note-taking. It bridges the gap between simple file-based note management and complex Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) systems like Obsidian, specifically optimized for deployment on Synology NAS environments via Docker.

## Target Audience
- **Home Laboratory Enthusiasts:** Users with Synology NAS setups looking for a seamless, Docker-integrated way to manage their notes without relying on third-party cloud services.
- **PKM Practitioners:** Individuals seeking a high-performance, web-based alternative to Obsidian that respects the "local-first" (or in this case, "NAS-first") data philosophy.
- **Developers:** Users who value lightweight, Docker-ready tools and a keyboard-centric, efficient workflow.

## Core Features & Values
- **NAS-First Data Ownership:** Direct integration with Synology NAS via Docker volumes, ensuring all notes stay on the user's hardware.
- **Mobile-First Responsiveness:** A smartphone-ready interface that allows users to easily create, view, and modify notes on the go.
- **Rich Markdown Experience:** A feature-complete Markdown editor supporting wiki-links, nested directories, and intuitive file exploration.
- **High Performance:** A clean, responsive interface with fast search and navigation, designed to handle large note collections without lag.
- **Simplicity & Power:** A "zero-config" initial setup with sensible defaults, while offering advanced features like keyboard-first navigation and command palettes.

## Long-Term Vision
Note Geval aims to become a full-featured web-based Obsidian alternative. This includes:
- **Obsidian Compatibility:** Support for standard Obsidian features like backlinks and metadata management.
- **Extensible Foundation:** A rock-solid core that can eventually support a plugin ecosystem.
- **Balanced UX:** Maintaining a lightweight and minimalist feel even as the feature set expands.
