# Spec: Enhance Mobile UX and Responsive Design

## Overview
Improve the Note Geval experience on mobile devices to ensure users can easily capture and manage notes on their smartphones. This includes responsive navigation, an optimized editor, and a streamlined file explorer.

## Requirements
- **Mobile-First Navigation:** Implement a bottom navigation bar or a slide-out drawer menu specifically for mobile screen sizes.
- **Editor Optimization:** Ensure the Markdown editor is fully usable on mobile, with appropriate font sizes, touch targets, and a focus on "quick capture."
- **Responsive File Explorer:** Adapt the file explorer to smaller screens, possibly using a collapsible tree or a dedicated mobile view.
- **Touch-Friendly UI:** Increase touch targets for buttons and links to at least 44x44px.
- **Fast Loading:** Ensure mobile performance is snappy.

## Success Criteria
- Navigation is intuitive on screens < 768px.
- Notes can be created and edited without zooming or horizontal scrolling on mobile.
- File tree is accessible and navigable on small screens.
- All core functions are reachable within two taps from the home screen.
